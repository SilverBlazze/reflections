1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   When working with several people in a project so that all files can easily be shared
   and any changes made are visible to everyone.
   
2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
   stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   
   To have more control over when to merge the changes done in the remote repository.
   
3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
   instead of another?

   With fork you clone a repository directly on Github, without having to first make a 
   local copy. A reference to the forked repository is saved. 
   This way you and other people can work in a project without having to modify the
   original.
   
   With clone you are downloading a repository to your computer, useful to allow several
   people to work in the same project.
   
   With branching you are creating a separte path of development so that any changes
   won't affect previous work in the master branch, it is useful to try new features or
   attemp to solve bugs.
   
4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
   locally?
   
   Being able to record how many new commits have been made since the last time we fetched
   data.
