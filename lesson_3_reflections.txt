1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   When working with several people in a project so that all files can easily be shared
   and any changes made are visible to everyone.
   
2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
   stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   
   To have more control over when to merge the changes done in the remote repository.
