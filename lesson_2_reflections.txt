1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   
   Git creates a .git folder which contains information of the files in the current directory.
   You need to do it in order to track changes done in your repository, and being able to
   perform different operations on the files and directories.
   
2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
   do you think it offers?
   
   It's different in the sense that the files that have been added to it have not yet been
   commited, thus not added to the repository yet. 
   It's like a temporal storage location that gives you more control over how the commits
   are going to be performed. It allows you to perform certain operations before commiting.
